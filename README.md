# Time-Limited Crystal Collector Game

**Description**:
This is a time-limited collection game where players spawn in the middle of an arena and must collect as many crystals as possible within the given time limit. The goal is to escape through the portal before the timer runs out, but each crystal collected adds more time to the countdown, giving you a little extra chance to reach the portal. Your score increases with each crystal collected, and the high score is saved after successfully escaping the arena.

### **Key Features**:
- **Objective**: Collect as many crystals as you can within the time limit and escape through the portal before the timer runs out.
- **Score**: Every crystal you collect adds a point to your score and adds extra time to the timer, making it more challenging.
- **Highscore**: The high score is updated only when you successfully escape before the time runs out. It can be reset in the main menu.
- **Portal**: Escape through the portal before the timer expires to complete the level and update the high score.
- **Jumping**: Use the spacebar to jump to avoid obstacles, reach higher platforms, or collect crystals placed in elevated positions.
- **Customizable Settings**: Adjust mouse sensitivity and music volume to your liking.
- **Pause Menu**: Pause the game during play, restart the level, or exit the game directly from the pause menu.
